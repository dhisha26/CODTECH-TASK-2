Objective: The main objective of this project is to create a secure user authentication system that enables users to register and log in to an application. This system will ensure that user passwords are stored securely and provide a straightforward interface for users to manage their accounts.

Key Activities: 1.User Registration: Create endpoint for new user registration. Validate input and hash passwords using bcrypt. 2.User Login: Create endpoint for user login. Authenticate user credentials and manage sessions or tokens. 3.Session/Token Management: Implement session-based (using cookies) or token-based (using JWT) authentication. 4.Error Handling: Handle registration and login errors effectively. Validate user inputs to ensure security. 5.Testing: Write tests for API endpoints and authentication flows.

Technologies used: .Backend Framework: Express.js (Node.js) or Flask (Python) .Database: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or SQLite .Password Hashing: bcrypt .Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or Express-session .Testing: Jest/Mocha (Node.js) or unittest/pytest (Python)
